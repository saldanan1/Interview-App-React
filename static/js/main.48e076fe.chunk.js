A congregation of my experiences and thoughts. I'm a graduate from Washington University in St. Louis with a BS in Computer Science. I bring a unique role to every team I am apart of: having technical experience from a Computer Science degree, but also having the human centered design and creative problem solving experience gained from my work. HCD and creative problem solving have been a key portion of my education and experiences. My goal is to cater to user experience and accessibility above all else."))))}a(41);var u=[{name:"Discord Elo Bot",description:"A discord bot aimed at tracking 'ratings' or 'elo' in online seasonal competitions. This is a passion project that started as a discussion between users on a Magic the Gathering(MTG) Discord Server. With the recent quarantine, people are unable to leave their homes to play MTG at their local card stores. With this, the MTG community has taken the online Discord Servers by storm. They have created competitive enviornments where users play online, and then 'log' them with the help of a Discord Bot. Wins and losses raise and lower your online 'score' respectively. Many issues were discovered with the current bot used on this server. These include and not limited to: restrictions, direct contact to the developer and user experiences being ignored. From this, a core group of designers, led by myself were assembled tocreate a new bot. With closed beta expected September 1st, we are aiming to expand to the greater magic community soon after. While in the development stage, the bot is being worked on by a few developers led by myself. As we reach our initial release, it will become an open sourced project with the hopes of including the community.",link:["https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/Discord%20Bot.png","https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/Discord%20Bot2.png","https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/Discord%20Bot3.png","https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/MongoDB.png"]},{name:"Discord Elo Bot2",description:"'NuVu is a full-time innovation school for middle and high school students.

Projects range greatly at NuVu, and I've had my fair share of them. From Aerial Filmmaking to Drone Assembly to RC Cars to AR Games to Battlebots, I have learned valuable design thinking, teaching and technical skills that have rounded out my classroom learning and proven extremely useful in my own projects.      Throughout my three summers working at NuVu, I taught, mentored, and helped foster growth in elementary and middle school boys and girls. Beyond the outward face of NuVu as a design and engineering enviornment, there is so much value in the lessons and experiences instilled into these children. Boys and girls leave with a greater understanding of how to approach and combat problems they face every day.

As frequent players, my friends and I were aware of similar products on the market. Many of these apps had underlining problems ranging from paid, easy to implement, features to bad coding which led to bugs and glitches.      MTGM was born from this. It is a solo passion project I developed during my Senior Year in college to combat the issues I had with similar apps. With close help from my college advisor (a professor of Swift and iOS development), I quickly became addicted to working on this project in between my classes. From conception to completition, the app was up on the Store in 3 months and taught me greatly about the submitting process, and, more importantly, the value of iteration and drawings.      Since its creation, I have completed two major updates to the app. In the future, I hope to return and add more using my new knowledge of Swift and Xcode",link:["https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/DMhomeicon.png","https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/MTGM%20in%20Store.png"]}],g=a(19),f=a(2),y=Object(s.a)((function(e){return{root:{display:"flex",flexWrap:"wrap",justifyContent:"space-around",overflow:"hidden",paddingBottom:100},gridList:{width:300,height:775}}})),v=function(){var e=y();return o.a.createElement(g.a,null,o.a.createElement("p",null,o.a.createElement("section",{className:"Welcome-text"},o.a.createElement("h1",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"Hey, I'm Noah Salda\xf1a")),o.a.createElement("section",{className:"Welcome-sub"},o.a.createElement("p",null,"iOS Developer - Student Mentor - Human-Centered Designer")),o.a.createElement("section",{className:"Nav"},o.a.createElement(g.b,{to:"/projects"},"Projects"),o.a.createElement(g.b,{to:"/aboutme"},"About Me")),o.a.createElement("section",null,o.a.createElement(l.a,{cellHeight:750,className:e.gridList,cols:1,alignItems:"flex-end"},o.a.createElement(c.a,{key:"profile-picture",cols:1},o.a.createElement("img",{src:"https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/IMG_3958.jpg",alt:"profile-picture"})))))),o.a.createElement(f.c,null,o.a.createElement(f.a,{path:"/projects"},o.a.createElement(w,null)),o.a.createElement(f.a,{path:"/aboutme"},o.a.createElement(b,null))))};function w(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement("header",{className:"App-header"},o.a.createElement("section",{id:"Pictures"},u.map((function(e){return o.a.createElement(m,{key:e.name,name:e.name,link:e.link,description:e.description})})))))}function b(){return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement(p,null))}Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(o.a.StrictMode,null,o.a.createElement(v,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[30,1,2]]]);
