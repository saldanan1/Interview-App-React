      description: "Magic the Gathering Manager (MTGM) is a life tracking app for the popular card game Magic the Gathering.\
      As frequent players, my friends and I were aware of similar products on the market.\
      Many of these apps had underlining problems ranging from paidfeatures to bad coding which led to bugs and glitches.\
      MTGM was born from this. It is a solo passion project I developed during my Senior Year in college to combat the issues I had with similar apps.\
      From conception to completition, the app was up on the Store in 3 months and taught me greatly about the submitting process, and, more importantly, the value of iteration and drawings.",      link: [
