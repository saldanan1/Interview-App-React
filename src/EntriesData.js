      description: "A discord bot aimed at tracking 'ratings' or 'elo' in online seasonal competitions. This is a passion project that started as a discussion between users on a Magic the Gathering(MTG) Discord Server.\
      With the recent quarantine, people are unable to leave their homes to play MTG at their local card stores. With this, the MTG community has taken the online Discord Servers by storm.\
      They have created competitive enviornments where users play online, and then 'log' them with the help of a Discord Bot.\
      Wins and losses raise and lower your online 'score' respectively. \With closed beta expected September 1st, we are aiming to expand to the greater magic community soon after.",

      description: "Magic the Gathering Manager (MTGM) is a life tracking app for the popular card game Magic the Gathering.\
      As frequent players, my friends and I were aware of similar products on the market.\
      Many of these apps had underlining problems ranging from paidfeatures to bad coding which led to bugs and glitches.\
      MTGM was born from this. It is a solo passion project I developed during my Senior Year in college to combat the issues I had with similar apps.\
      From conception to completition, the app was up on the Store in 3 months and taught me greatly about the submitting process, and, more importantly, the value of iteration and drawings.",      link: [
