With the recent quarantine, people are unable to leave their homes to play MTG at their local card stores. With this, the MTG community has taken the online Discord Servers by storm. They have created competitive enviornments where users play online, and then 'log' them with the help of a Discord Bot. Wins and losses raise and lower your online 'score' respectively. Many issues were discovered with the current bot used on this server. These include and not limited to: restrictions, direct contact to the developer and user experiences being ignored. From this, a core group of designers, led by myself were assembled tocreate a new bot. With closed beta expected September 1st, we are aiming to expand to the greater magic community soon after. While in the development stage, the bot is being worked on by a few developers led by myself. As we reach our initial release, it will become an open sourced project with the hopes of including the community.\",\n      link: [\n        'https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/Discord%20Bot.png',\n        \"https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/Discord%20Bot2.png\",\n        \"https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/Discord%20Bot3.png\",\n        \"https://noahsaldanadesign.com/img/MongoDB.png\"\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      name: \"NuVu\",\n      description: \"'NuVu is a full-time innovation school for middle and high school students.

Beyond the outward face of NuVu as a design and engineering enviornment, there is so much value in the lessons and experiences instilled into these children.
